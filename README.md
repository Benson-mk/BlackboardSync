# BlackboardSync
### Sync your blackboard to your computer

BlackboardSync connects to your blackboard, allowing you to keep a local copy of assignments, lab sheets and lectures available as part of your courses.



You will need to know your Blackboard user id, currently there's no known easy way to obtain it.

Try playing around with the [Blackboard API](https://developer.blackboard.com/portal/displayApi), alternatively, send me an email with your full name.
